# Dataset Snapshot: Predicting Strokes
## Background

Globally, strokes stand out as a major health threat, becoming the second most frequent cause of death. With insights from the World Health Organization, we understand that strokes make up a daunting 11% of all mortality instances. In light of this, the ability to predict strokes with precision is critically significant.

This dataset has been meticulously curated to facilitate such predictions. It integrates a plethora of patient-centric attributes, spanning personal details, medical histories, and lifestyle patterns. Each data entry dives deep into individual profiles, ensuring a holistic approach to the analysis.
